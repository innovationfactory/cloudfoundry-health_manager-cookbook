Description
===========

Installs and configures a CloudFoundry Health Manager.

Requirements
============

Platform
--------

* Ubuntu

Tested on:

* Ubuntu 10.04

Cookbooks
---------

Requires Opscode's bluepill cookbook for creating init scripts and
trotter's cloudfoundry-common cookbook.

Usage
=====

This cookbook will install the CloudFoundry Health Manager on the target
node along with the necessary configuration files and init scripts to
run it. Because the database required by a Health Manager is shared with
the CloudController, you need to use the
`cloudfoundry-cloud_controller::database` recipe from the
`cloudfoundry-cloud_controller` cookbook to setup the Health Manager's
database. Assuming you're running a Health Manager on the same machine
as your Cloud Controller, typical usage in a recipe will look like so:

    include_recipe "cloudfoundry-cloud_controller"
    include_recipe "cloudfoundry-health_manager"
